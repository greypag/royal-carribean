<p>
a. Baggage Limits and Prohibited Items. Each adult Passenger is permitted to carry onboard
the Vessel or check-in only the wearing apparel and personal effects reasonably necessary for
the Cruise or Cruise Tour, including suitcases, trunks, valises, satchels, bags, hangers
containing clothing, toiletries and similar items. In no event shall any Passenger bring on

controlled substances, fireworks, live animals (except under the terms of Section 12.e below),
weapons, firearms, explosives or other hazardous materials, or any other items prohibited by
applicable law or Carrier policy. Carrier reserves the right to refuse to permit any Passenger
to take on board the Vessel or on any mode of Transport any item Carrier deems
inappropriate.
</br>
b. Liability for Loss of or Damage to Baggage. Unless negligent, Carrier is neither responsible
nor liable for any loss of or damage to Passenger's property, whether contained in luggage or
otherwise. Liability for loss of or damage to Passenger's property in connection with any air or

of law or this Agreement, Carrier's liability for loss or damage to property during the Land
Tour portion of a CruiseTour is limited to US$300.00 per Passenger. Notwithstanding any
other provision of law or this Ticket Contract, Carrier's liability for loss or damage to property
for the Cruise (or for the Cruise only portion of a CruiseTour) is limited to US$300.00 per
Passenger, unless Passenger declares the true value of such property in writing and pays
Carrier within 10 days of final payment for the cruise, a fee of five percent (5%) of the amount
that such value exceeds US$300.00. In such event, Carrier's liability shall be limited to its true
declared value, but not exceeding US$5,000.
</br>
d. Limited Carriage. Carrier does not undertake to carry as baggage any tools of trade,
household goods (including but not limited to appliances and furniture), fragile or valuable
items, precious metals, jewelry, documents, negotiable instruments or other valuables,
including but not limited to those specified in Title 46 of the United States Code, Appendix
Section 181. Each Passenger warrants that no such item will be presented to Carrier within
any receptacle or container as baggage, and hereby releases Carrier from any liability
whatsoever for loss of or damage to such items when presented to Carrier in breach of this
warranty. In no event shall Carrier be liable for normal wear or tear of luggage or property, or
loss of or damage to jewelry, cash, negotiable paper, photographic/electronic, medical or
recreational equipment, dental hardware, eyewear, medications or other valuables unless they
are deposited with Carrier on the Vessel for safekeeping against receipt (LTOs do not accept
valuables for deposit). Carrier's liability, if any, for loss of or damage to valuables so deposited
shall not exceed the amounts indicated in Section 3.c above.
</p>

<p style="color:#195f9b; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;">4. MEDICAL CARE AND OTHER PERSONAL SERVICES</p>
<p>
a. Availability of Medical Care. Due to the nature of travel by sea and the ports visited, the
availability of medical care onboard the Vessel and in ports of call may be limited or delayed
and medical evacuation may not be possible from the Vessel while at sea or from every
location to which the Vessel sails.
</br>
b. Relationship with Service Providers. To the extent Passengers retain the services of medical
personnel or independent contractors on or off the Vessel, Passengers do so at their sole risk.
Any medical personnel attending to a Passenger on or off the Vessel, if arranged by Carrier,
are provided solely for the convenience of the Passenger, work directly for the Passenger, and
shall not be deemed to be acting under the control or supervision of the Carrier, as Carrier is
not a medical provider. Likewise, any onboard concessions (including but not limited to the
gift shops, spas, beauty salon, art program, photography and formalwear concessions) are
either operated by or are independent contractors on board the Vessel, on Transport or
elsewhere and are provided solely for the convenience of Passenger. Even though the Carrier
shall be entitled to charge a fee and earn a profit for arranging such services, all such persons
or entities shall be deemed independent contractors and not acting as agents or
representatives of Carrier. Carrier assumes no liability whatsoever for any treatment, failure to
treat, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, actual or alleged malpractice, advice, examination or other
services provided by such persons or entities. Passenger acknowledges that the Vessel's hair
dresser, manicurist, art auctioneer, gift shop personnel, spa personnel, wedding planners and
other providers of merchandise and personal services are employees of independent
contractors and that Carrier is not responsible for their actions.
</br>
c. Payment for Medical or Personal Care Services. Passenger shall pay for all medical care or
other personal services requested or required, whether onboard or ashore, including the cost
of any emergency medical care or transportation incurred by Carrier and any costs associated
with the provision of medical services as provided in the CLIA Passenger Bill of Rights. If
Passenger is unable to pay and the Carrier pays for such expenses, then Passenger shall
reimburse Carrier for those expenses.
</p>

<p style="color:#195f9b; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;">5. SHORE EXCURSIONS, TOURS, FACILITIES OR OTHER TRANSPORTATION</p>
<p>
All arrangements made for or by Passenger for transportation (other than on the Vessel)
before, during or after the Cruise or CruiseTour of any kind whatsoever, as well as air
arrangements, shore excursions, tours, hotels, restaurants, attractions and other similar
activities or services, including all related conveyances, products or facilities, are made solely
for Passenger's convenience and are undertaken at Passenger's risk. The providers and owners
and carriers of such services, conveyances, products and facilities are independent contractors
and are not acting as representatives of Carrier. Even though Carrier may collect a fee for, or
otherwise profit from, making such arrangements and offers for sale shore excursions, tours,
hotels, restaurants, attractions, the Land Tour and other similar activities or services taking
place off the Vessel for a profit, it does not undertake to supervise or control such independent
contractors or their employees, nor maintain their conveyances or facilities, and makes no
representation, whether express or implied, regarding their suitability or safety. In no event
shall Carrier be liable for any loss, delay, disappointment, damage, injury, death or other harm
whatsoever to Passenger which occurs on or off the Vessel or the Transport as a result of any
acts, omissions or negligence of any independent contractors.
</p>

<p style="color:#195f9b; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;">6. CANCELLATION, DEVIATION OR SUBSTITUTION BY CARRIER</p>
<p>
a. Carrier may for any reason at any time and without prior notice, cancel, advance, postpone
or deviate from any scheduled sailing, port of call, destination, lodging or any activity on or
off the Vessel, or substitute another vessel or port of call, destination, lodging or activity.
Except as provided in Section 6.e below, Carrier shall not be liable for any claim whatsoever by
Passenger, including but not limited to loss, compensation or refund, by reason of such
cancellation, advancement, postponement, substitution or deviation.
</br>
b. In connection with a CruiseTour, Carrier has the same right to cancel, advance, postpone or
deviate from any scheduled activity, departure or destination, or substitute another railcar,
bus, destination or lodging or other component of the CruiseTour. Except as provided in
Section 6.e below, Carrier shall not be liable for any claim by Passenger whatsoever, including
but not limited to loss, compensation or refund, by reason of such cancellation, advancement,
postponement, substitution or deviation.
</br>
c. By way of example, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Carrier may,
without liability (except as provided in Section 6.e with respect to mechanical failures only) ,
deviate from any scheduled sailing and may otherwise land Passenger and her property at
any port if Carrier believes that the voyage or any Passenger or property may be hindered or
adversely affected as a result of hostilities, blockages, prevailing weather conditions, labor
conflicts, strikes onboard or ashore, breakdown of Vessel, congestion, docking difficulties,
medical or life-saving emergencies or any other cause whatsoever.
</br>
d. Carrier shall have the right to comply with any orders, recommendations, or directions
whatsoever given by any governmental entity or by persons purporting to act with such
authority and such compliance shall not be deemed a breach of the terms under this
Agreement entitling the Passenger to assert any claim for liability, compensation or refund.
</br>
e. In the event that the Cruise (or the Cruise component of a CruiseTour) is cancelled or
terminated early due to mechanical failures: (i) Passenger shall have a right to a full refund of
the Cruise Fare if the Cruise is cancelled in full, or a partial refund if the Cruise is terminated
early; (ii) Carrier may cover or reimburse Passenger for additional costs (e.g. airline change
fees) as deemed appropriate by the Carrier; (iii) if Passenger has travelled to the Vessel,
Passenger shall have a right to transportation (by means selected by the Carrier) to the Vessel’s
scheduled port of disembarkation or the Passenger’s home city; and (iv) Passenger shall have a
right to lodging (selected by the Carrier) if disembarkation and an overnight stay in an
unscheduled port are required due to the Cruise or Cruise component of a CruiseTour being
cancelled or terminated early because of such mechanical failures.
</p>

<p style="color:#195f9b; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;">7. CANCELLATION OR EARLY DISEMBARKATION BY PASSENGER</p>
<p>
Your Cruise Fare or CruiseTour Fares, including but not limited to any fuel or other
supplemental charges, government taxes and fees and other charges are established by your
travel representative that took your booking and not the Carrier. Similarly, the payment
schedule for your Cruise Fare or CruiseTour Fares is established by your travel representative
that took your booking and not the Carrier. In addition, all cancellation and refund policies for
your Cruise Fare or CruiseTour fares are established by your travel representative that took
your booking and not the Carrier.
</br>
Any refund due to Passenger as a result of cancellation by the Passenger both prior to or after
the Cruise or CruiseTour has begun shall be established and determined by the travel
representative that handled your booking who shall have sole liability for any refunds, where
applicable. In the event of cancellation by the Passenger prior to the Cruise or CruiseTour, or
early disembarkation of the Passenger for any reason, including pursuant to any provision of
this Ticket Contract, such disembarkation shall be without refund, compensation, or liability
on the part of the Carrier whatsoever.
</br>
Any payments of the Cruise Fare or CruiseTour Fares shall be made to the third party reseller
and not the Carrier. If Carrier received payment via credit card, the refund will be made to
that credit card. If Carrier received payment from your travel representative, the refund will
be provided back to that travel representative.
</br>
Passenger acknowledges that for certain voyages, such as a round-trip voyage commencing in
a United States port, the Passenger must complete the entire voyage and that failure to do so
may result in a fine or other penalty being assessed by one or more governmental agencies.
Passenger hereby agrees to pay any such fine or penalty imposed because Passenger failed to
complete the entire voyage and to reimburse Carrier in the event it is required to pay, or has
paid, such fine or penalty.
</p>

with Carrier's rules and procedures, including, for example, Carrier's Guest Conduct Policy or
Carrier's policies against fraternization with crew; or (v) Passenger's passage is denied by
