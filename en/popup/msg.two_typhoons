There are two typhoons Goni and Atsani currently churning through the tropical western Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />

Given these stormsâ€™ current location and projected paths, Voyager of the Seas which will depart on 19 Aug 2015 will face the typhoons on her return from Japan. Due to the adverse weather and to ensure our guests have a safe and comfortable cruise, we have no other option but to revise your itinerary as the waves are expected to be up to 8-10 meters high. The scheduled itinerary to Xiamen, Fukuoka and Nagasaki has been replaced with Nha Trang and Phu My (Ho Chi Minh City). The new itinerary in detail is as follows:
