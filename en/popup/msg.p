<p>Please be informed that typhoon Dujuan will move in the general direction of Ryukyu Islands to the seas east of Taiwan in the next few days. To ensure our guests have a safe and comfortable voyage, Voyager of the Seas departing on 26 September 2015, the scheduled itinerary to Xiamen and Okinawa has been replaced with Xiamen and Danang (Chan May). Â As a gesture of goodwill, for those guests who proceed to sail on this sailing will receive onboard credit. For those guests who do not want to proceed have an option to refund 50% of their cruise fare.</p>
<p>We sincerely regret the impact that the adverse weather is having on your plan, and thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
