<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">1. Make sure someone is taking care of any pets. Get a friend or neighbor to feed the fish, walk the dog and water your plants. You’ll feel much better knowing they'll be safe and sound when you return.

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Put your lights and/or radio on a timer. People shouldn't be able to tell you're away just by looking at your house. A simple timer can turn the lights and a radio or TV on after dark.

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">3. Make sure someone gets your mail/newspapers. Same reason as #2. Plus, there's only so much mail the postman can jam into your mailbox. You could also arrange to have the post office hold your mail for the period which you’re away.


</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Make sure everything that needs to be turned off is off. Your vacation should be worry-free, and that includes thoughts like did I leave the stove on?. Double-check before you leave the house. You can even unplug non-essential appliances like your computer, TV and other electronics.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"> 5. Get rid of perishable items and leftovers. No one wants to come home to mouldy things in the fridge. If it's not eaten the night before you leave, just toss it away.

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 6. Turn the water off. Close the water valves for your sinks, dishwasher and clothes washer. That way nothing can leak and make a mess while you're away.

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">7. Keep track of your house keys. When you don't use them for a week or more, it's easy to forget where you put them. Find a spot in your carry-on luggage where they'll be safe for the duration of your trip.
